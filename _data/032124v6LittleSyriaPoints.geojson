The newspaper was not only prominent in Little Syria; it was available by subscription throughout the United States, Cuba, and Mexico. Fatat Boston was representative of civic activism in and around Little Syria as people came together to debate politics and share both local and international news. Shakir stopped publishing Fatat Boston in the early 1920s but remained active in both printing and politics. Wadie's wife, Hannah Sabbagh Shakir, was a founder of the Lebanese Syrian Ladies' Aid Association. Their daughter, the literary scholar <a href=\"https://aanm.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16806coll9\" target=\"blank\">Evelyn Shakir</a> (1938-2010), tells parts of the family's story in Bint Arab (1997) and Teaching Arabs, Writing Self: Memoirs of an Arab-American Woman (posthumous, 2013).",

Maronite Christianity falls under the umbrella of Eastern Orthodoxy and is in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church. It has many adherents in Lebanon, particularly the region of Mount Lebanon near Beirut. Syrian churches in the US were important places for immigrants to socialize, speak their own language, network to find a job, find a spouse, and celebrate holidays. The <a href=\"https://www.ourladyofthecedars.org/history-of-parish\" target=\"blank\">original building</a>, a one-story church, is now gone. Father Joseph Yazbek obtained the four-story building here at 78 Tyler Street and dedicated it in 1899. In 1902, it held an Easter Bazaar to raise funds, which was opened by the Mayor Patrick Andrew Collins, suggesting the church played a prominent role in the neighborhood. In 1931, it held a memorial service for famed writer Kahlil Gibran, who spent part of his youth in Boston’s Little Syria. The building grew too small for its congregation and the church was moved to another building on Shawmut Street, and then moved a few times until it reached its current home in Jamaica Plain in 1969. In 1946, the 78 Tyler Street church building was dedicated as a Chinese Christian mission.",

Boston architect Gridley J. F. Bryant, who created some of the foundational buildings of Tufts College and Harvard University, designed the school building according to the principles of the Greek Revival style which was popular in Boston at the time for alluding to emulating the democratic ideals that the US was founded on. Unfortunately due to a fire and a hurricane, the building has lost important stylistic elements that drew from ancient temples. From the 1940s, it served Chinatown's growing community as well as children of Syrian, Irish, Italian and other ethnicities. By 1976, over 90% of students were Chinese American. In the same year, the school moved to another site, and in 1983 the building was bought by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association which continues to preserve and share Chinese culture in the neighborhood.",

Similar to other settlement houses, such as Hull House in Chicago, it provided social services, classes, and often food and accommodation to new immigrants. Although Denison House served a variety of ethnicities, it hosted activities that catered especially to Syrians, such as a Syrian Mothers’ Club organized by Amelia Earhart, who was a social worker here when she wasn’t piloting airplanes. Writer Kahlil Gibran moved to Boston with his mother and siblings in 1895, when he was 12 years old; here he found an entrée into Boston’s bohemian art world through art classes. Like other settlement houses, Denison was more than a charity—it perceived itself as an engine of upward mobility. It moved to Dorchester in 1942 and later merged with other local social service providers; today apartments inhabit its former location.

This square was dedicated three years later on Oct 25, 1921, alongside a parade of 3,000 people–mostly Syrians–to commemorate the sacrifices of soldiers, particularly those of immigrants and children of immigrants. One of the dedicators was the Mount Lebanon Club, a civic and social organization similar to those found on this map, such as the Syrian American Club and the Lebanese and Syrian Ladies’ Aid Association. Arabic speakers may notice that his original surname was “Lutfy”--like many other Syrians in the U.S., his name was adjusted to make it easier for non-Arabic speakers to pronounce.",

He fought in WWII, including in the Invasion of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge, and was a highly-decorated veteran.

Sadie was the president of the Bradford Street Neighborhood Association and George was a shoemaker. After the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) was established by the City of Boston in 1957, it took possession of what is now Peter’s Park with the goal of “urban renewal” in 1966. Shortly thereafter, there was a major fire, and the houses that had stood along Bradford Street were never rebuilt. Syrian and Lebanese residents of the neighborhood were heavily involved in the campaign against the BRA’s urban renewal project, including Sadie and George Peters. Another Syrian, Nabeeha Hajjar, explained in an <a href=\"https://archives.boston.gov/repositories/2/digital_objects/1901\" target=\"blank\">oral history interview</a> with the City of Boston that while she was originally a BRA delegate from the neighborhood, she soon grew disillusioned by the BRA’s claim to improving conditions–none of the projects seem to come to fruition, at least not in ways that served the community. Urban renewal, combined with the construction of the “Central Artery” of the Mass Pike (I-90), contributed to the exodus of the Syrian community to suburbs between 1950s and 1970s. Despite this, a large stone dedicated to the Peters on July 3, 1976 sits proudly in the park that is their namesake today.",

Four Syrian churches were clustered on Hudson and Tyler Streets in the early 20th century, among them <a href=\"https://www.stgeorgeofboston.org/\" target=\"blank\">St. George’s Antiochian Orthodox Church</a>, established by Fr. George Maloof (1848-1920) in 1900. St. George’s operated under the spiritual direction of Bishop Raphael Hawawini (Saint Raphael of Brooklyn), the first Syrian Orthodox patriarch to be consecrated in North America. The church occupied several different locations over the years, including 6 Oxford St. (Father George’s home), 38 Edinboro, and 32 Hudson, before the cornerstone of a new building was laid on Tyler St in 1923. St. George’s eventually followed its congregants out of Little Syria and is today located in West Roxbury. More about the history of the church and its members can be found in a <a href=\"https://github.com/chloebordewich/boston-little-syria/blob/9e34ac6bf1d0d803e71fac9ff73bce020915eab0/Calling%20to%20Remembrance_Collected%20Essays_Fr%20Timothy%20Ferguson.pdf \" target=\"blank\">collection of essays</a> written by Fr.

Sadie was the president of the Bradford Street Neighborhood Association and George was a shoemaker. After the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) was established by the City of Boston in 1957, it took possession of what is now Peter’s Park with the goal of “urban renewal” in 1966. Shortly thereafter, there was a major fire, and the houses that had stood along Bradford Street were never rebuilt. Syrian and Lebanese residents of the neighborhood were heavily involved in the campaign against the BRA’s urban renewal project, including Sadie and George Peters. Another Syrian, Nabeeha Hajjar, explained in an <a href=\"https://archives.boston.gov/repositories/2/digital_objects/1901\" target=\"blank\">oral history interview</a> with the City of Boston that while she was originally a BRA delegate from the neighborhood, she soon grew disillusioned by the BRA’s claim to improving conditions–none of the projects seem to come to fruition, at least not in ways that served the community. Urban renewal, combined with the construction of the “Central Artery” of the Mass Pike (I-90), contributed to the exodus of the Syrian community to suburbs between 1950s and 1970s. Despite this, a large stone dedicated to the Peters on July 3, 1976 sits proudly in the park that is their namesake today.",

Additionally, these stores attract new customers who want to try food and items they are not familiar with. In the case of today’s gentrified South End, Syrian Grocery Importing Co. serves both a smaller, older Syrian clientele and newer residents of the neighborhood.

In business from 1965 to 1972, Sahara was open from four in the afternoon to three in the morning, offering dine-in and take-out. One advertisement notes their expertise in serving “shish-ke-bab,” “lamb delicacies,” “tempting pastry,” hummus, grape leaves, and kibbe, as well as “steak and chops - fit for a sultan!” By catering to both Syrian and American palates, Sahara attracted crowds of hungry diners in Boston’s competitive restaurant industry. It also attracted crowds through its African name and imagery that are in reality far-removed from Syria yet appealed to Americans’ exotic idea of the Middle East. The restaurant was eventually sold to the Mansour family, who still own it along with Syrian Grocery Importing Co. at 270 Shawmut Avenue. Walking down Shawmut Ave in the South End, it is impossible to look past Sahara’s colorful, retro sign without wondering why the building has been shuttered these long decades and what its future has in store.",

Never visiting the Middle East himself, he captivated live audiences at haflehs and mahrajans (Syrian festivals) across the US and Canada. A few of his many songs are “Bas Oolee” (“Please Tell Me”), “Ya Ka Weeya Albi,” (“O Hot Iron on My Heart”), and “Ya Binty” (“Daughter of Mine”). He also performed one of the era’s most popular songs, “Misirlou,” an old tune that was traded among Greek, Arab, Jewish, and Armenian musicians before finding its way into Quentin Tarantino’s 1994 cult classic Pulp Fiction. Abdelahad and his bandmates belonged to a <http://syrianlebanesediasporasound.blogspot.com/2021/02/gabriel-s-maloofs-syrian-oriental.html\" target=\"blank\">vibrant</a> musical scene. ",

Syrians brought their skills in production and connections to silk weavers back home to the US. Many women migrating from Syria knew how to make lace and continued to do so in Boston, some selling it.

In 1914, St. John’s split from St. George’s Orthodox Church in 1907, drawing members of the congregation who had come from Damascus and surrounding areas. The church moved out of the neighborhood in 1956, first expanding to a larger location on Museum Road, and eventually to its current location in Dedham.

In 1905, dramatic insults and accusations by the editors of each magazine toward each other and toward religious leaders of other sects spilled violently in to the streets of Manhattan’s Little Syria neighborhood. Syrian Bostonians subscribed to these newspapers and took part in the American and Syrian political and religious discourse of the day. On a boiling hot day that summer, a minor quarrel between Syrian neighbors erupted into a full blown sectarian riot that came to be known as the South End Riot. According to Father Timothy Ferguson, the fighting lasted around twenty-four hours, as Irish policemen arrested participants and Father George Maloof of St. George Orthodox Church prevailed upon his parishioners to make peace with their neighbors.",

Six months later, the Globe reassured readers that Sophie had been quickly found; her hasty marriage had been annulled; and she was married to her betrothed. By 1915, the coffeeshop was called Kawkab al-Sharq. The next year, the site was occupied by a restaurant run by George Abourjeily, possibly with the same name.

After working as a peddler and court interpreter, he was able to purchase property to open a dry goods store and a boarding house on Oliver Place, now Ping On Alley. There is conflicting evidence as to the exact street number. Known as the \"mukhtar\" (mayor) of the Syrian community in Boston, Khadra gave advice to and settled disputes among his fellow Syrians. The boarding house was a place in which new immigrants could stay upon arrival while working and saving money to move elsewhere.",

While the term “Syrian” is used to describe this neighborhood and its residents, in the wake of World War I, Lebanon became its own state separate from the new state of Syria, and many Americans who had previously fallen into the category of “Syrian” now embraced the identity of “Lebanese.” Some social clubs changed their names from “Syrian” to “Syrian and Lebanese” while others used “Lebanese” only, depending on the origin of their members. Additionally, the inclusion of the word “Citizen” emphasizes members’ legal and permanent status in the US.",
