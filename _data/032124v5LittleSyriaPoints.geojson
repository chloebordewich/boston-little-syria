Sadie was the president of the Bradford Street Neighborhood Association and George was a shoemaker. After the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) was established by the City of Boston in 1957, it took possession of what is now Peter’s Park with the goal of “urban renewal” in 1966. Shortly thereafter, there was a major fire, and the houses that had stood along Bradford Street were never rebuilt. Syrian and Lebanese residents of the neighborhood were heavily involved in the campaign against the BRA’s urban renewal project, including Sadie and George Peters. Another Syrian, Nabeeha Hajjar, explained in an <a href=\"https://archives.boston.gov/repositories/2/digital_objects/1901\" target=\"blank\">oral history interview</a> with the City of Boston that while she was originally a BRA delegate from the neighborhood, she soon grew disillusioned by the BRA’s claim to improving conditions–none of the projects seem to come to fruition, at least not in ways that served the community. Urban renewal, combined with the construction of the “Central Artery” of the Mass Pike (I-90), contributed to the exodus of the Syrian community to suburbs between 1950s and 1970s.
